# `reference/burst_grid.json` holds what that function computes for the granules the golden values come
# from, dumped by `reference/dump_burst_grid.py`. Two of its conventions differ from this reader's and
# the tests assert the difference rather than absorbing it: the reference writes bursts in turn and lets
# a later one overwrite the odd row a midpoint split leaves shared, so its *effective* extents are what
# a reader placing each burst once must match; and it slices range samples with an exclusive end against
# an inclusive index, dropping the last valid sample of every burst, which this reader keeps.
