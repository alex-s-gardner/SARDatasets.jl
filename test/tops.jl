# Whether an acquisition's samples carry a TOPS azimuth ramp.
#
# This is the question a consumer of `pixels` has to ask before interpolating them, and it lives here
# because the answer is a property of how the product was collected — which this package reads and a
# geometry or correlation package cannot infer.
#
# What makes it worth testing rather than obvious: the answer has to be right for four different backend
# kinds, and one of them does not inherit it. `MergedBurstBackend` describes several bursts and subtypes
# `AbstractSLCBackend` rather than `AbstractBurstBackend`, so it would default to `false` without a method
# of its own. A merge silently reported as non-TOPS is exactly the case that would reach a resampler.
