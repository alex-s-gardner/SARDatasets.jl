# Bursts as ASF's burst extractor delivers them.

# The URL check needs no network. Everything else needs burst files, so it runs only where a directory
# holding them is named: set `SLCDATASETS_ASF_DIR` to one, together with the granule the files came from
# and an orbit file for it. `asf_bursts` fetches into such a directory and does not fetch again, so a
# directory filled by an earlier run is what these read.
