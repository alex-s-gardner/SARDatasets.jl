# The Sentinel-1 reader against golden values dumped from isce3 + s1reader.
#
# The scalars the two must agree on bitwise are compared with `===` against the reference's hex
# literals, so these assert agreement with what ISCE3 computed rather than agreement to a printed
# precision. Times are compared as absolute instants — `epoch` plus the offset — because this package's
# epoch is truncated to the second where the reference's keeps microseconds, and only the instant they
# denote is a claim about the product.
#
# The granules themselves are multi-gigabyte and not in the repository, so the products these run
# against are rebuilt from `reference/sentinel1_inputs*.json`, which carries the annotation fields and
# state vectors of each granule verbatim — the text as the annotation writes it, so the reader parses
# what it would have parsed from the granule. The comparison against ISCE3 is therefore hardcoded and
# runs anywhere.
#
# Setting `SLCDATASETS_S1_DIR` to a directory holding the granules named in the golden files reads those
# instead. Both modes assert the same values, which is what keeps the rebuilt products honest: if a
# reader change made them diverge, the granule run would fail where the fixture run passed.
