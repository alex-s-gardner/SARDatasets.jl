# Folding a subswath's bursts into one acquisition.
#
# The bursts of a subswath are already `SLC`s, so the merge takes them rather than a product and a range:
# whatever vector a caller has — a whole subswath, a slice of one, the result of a `filter` — is the
# selection. What comes back is an `SLC` like any other, so everything downstream of this package reads
# it without knowing it was merged.
#
# The work that is not layout is reconciling the clocks. Each burst reports its times against an epoch
# derived from its own start, so a subswath of nine bursts carries nine different epochs and their
# `sensing_start` values are not on one scale — differencing them across a subswath is out by the whole
# spread of the epochs, some tens of seconds. The merged acquisition adopts the first burst's epoch and
# re-references every other burst onto it, which is the same reconciliation `repeat_interval` performs
# for a pair of products.

Which burst a line of a merged image belongs to, and which line of that burst it is.

Both count from one: `burst` indexes the acquisition's own bursts, as [`deramp_parameters`](@ref) takes it,
and `burst_line` is the row within that burst.

This is what a consumer removing the TOPS azimuth ramp needs. The ramp is quadratic about each burst's
*own* center, so a merged image carries one ramp per burst rather than a single one, and a phase evaluated
against merged-grid rows alone would be wrong by up to half a burst. Merging places bursts at whole-row
offsets and divides their overlap at the midpoint, so every row belongs to exactly one burst.

Throws for a line outside the image, and for an acquisition that is not a merge — a single burst is all its
own lines, and a mosaic has no single burst structure.

    merge_bursts(bursts::AbstractVector{<:SLC}; tolerance = MAX_BURST_GRID_RESIDUAL) -> SLC

Place consecutive bursts of one subswath on a single uniform azimuth grid.

The bursts must come from one product, subswath and polarization, and be consecutive and in order —
which is what [`bursts`](@ref) returns, so a whole subswath or any slice of one merges directly. The
result is an [`SLC`](@ref) whose `nlines` spans from the first burst's first line to the last burst's
last, with the overlap between neighbours divided at its midpoint rather than repeated.

A line's azimuth time is `sensing_start + line / prf` throughout the result, which is what
[`RadarGeometry`](@ref) means by `prf` and what a stack of whole bursts would break at every seam. The
samples are placed rather than resampled: each burst's start lands on the shared grid within a fraction
of a line, and `tolerance` is how far it may be off before the merge is refused.

Use [`pixels`](@ref) or [`amplitude`](@ref) for the samples, which are read as they are indexed, and
[`validmask`](@ref) for which of them were imaged.

```julia
b = bursts(safe; orbit = eof, swath = 2)
