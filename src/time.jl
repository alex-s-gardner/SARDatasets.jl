A UTC instant to better than millisecond resolution: `datetime` truncated to the whole second, plus
`seconds` of residual.

The residual is normally in `[0, 1)`, but is allowed past one second so a time can be advanced by an
arbitrary offset without renormalizing; [`seconds_between`](@ref) and `_utc_string` both handle that.
