# The single entry point that opens a product, and the dispatch that picks its reader.
#
# A source is separate from a backend: the backend knows a sensor's group and dataset names, the
# source knows how to get a readable file. Splitting them means a new sensor costs a backend and a new
# access route costs a source, rather than one costing both.

"""
    open_slc(src; frequency = nothing, orbit = nothing, swath = nothing, swaths = nothing,
             burst = nothing, polarization = nothing) -> SLC

Open a SAR acquisition.

`src` is an [`AbstractSLCSource`](@ref), or a path or URL, which is resolved to one. The sensor
backend is chosen by inspecting the product rather than by the caller naming it, so the same call
serves every supported format.

The identification and geometry records are read here; the state vectors are read on first access.

# NISAR

`frequency` selects the sub-band, defaulting to the first the product lists.

# Sentinel-1

`orbit` is the path to the POEORB or RESORB `.EOF` file holding the state vectors, and is required:
a Sentinel-1 product does not contain its own orbit.

A TOPS product is three subswaths of bursts rather than one image, so there are two geometries to
ask for. By default the result spans `swaths` — all three — the way hyp3-autorift's
`loadMetadataSlc` does. Passing `burst` instead describes that single burst of the single subswath
`swath`, matching `loadMetadata`. Use [`nbursts`](@ref) for the burst count.

`polarization` defaults to the first of `vv`, `vh`, `hh`, `hv` the product carries.

Every burst of one Sentinel-1 subswath, as a vector of [`SLC`](@ref)s.

the product — unlike calling [`open_slc`](@ref) once per burst, which re-reads it each time.
