# Bursts as ASF distributes them, one file per burst.
#
# ASF's burst extractor serves a Sentinel-1 SLC as its individual bursts: `{i}.tiff` is one burst's
# raster and `{i}.xml` its metadata, both indexed from zero at
# `sentinel1-burst.asf.alaska.edu/{slc}/{swath}/{pol}/`. So a caller wanting a few bursts of a subswath
# transfers those bursts rather than the several gigabytes of the whole product.
#
# The raster has the same layout a `.SAFE` measurement file does — uncompressed, one strip per line,
# complex 16-bit samples — so `open_tiff` reads it unchanged. Unlike a `.SAFE`, each is its own file
# holding one burst, which is why a merge places them at row offset zero rather than at a burst's offset
# into a stacked raster.
#
# The XML is not a slice of the annotation. It wraps the *whole* product's annotation for every subswath:
# `<burst><metadata><product><swath>IW2</swath><content>` holds a complete product annotation listing
# every burst of the parent SLC, not just the one fetched. So `read_annotation` parses the `<content>`
# subtree as it stands, and which burst the file holds is known from its index rather than from the XML.

    AsfBurst(slc, swath, polarization, burst; dir = nothing) -> AsfBurst

One burst of a Sentinel-1 SLC, from ASF's burst extractor.

`slc` is the parent granule's name, `burst` its **1-based** index within the subswath — the extractor
addresses bursts from zero and the conversion happens here, so that a burst has the same number it has
everywhere else in this package.

Both files are fetched whole rather than by range: a burst raster is a couple of hundred megabytes and is
wanted entire. `dir` is where they are kept, defaulting to a temporary directory; pass one to keep them
across sessions, and an already-downloaded file there is not fetched again.

Authentication is from `~/.netrc`, as for [`RemoteHTTP`](@ref), so a `urs.earthdata.nasa.gov` entry is
the only setup. The extractor generates a burst on first request and answers `202` until it is ready;
this retries until it is.
