#
# An SLC is not a bag of arbitrary named variables — it is a fixed, known set of geometry quantities. So
# the metadata is plain immutable structs rather than a variable/attribute protocol, and only the bulky
# part, the state vectors, is deferred.
#
# The field set is what a geometry consumer needs, taken from the two reference loaders in
# hyp3-autorift's `testGeogrid.py`: `loadMetadataRslc` for NISAR and `loadMetadata` for Sentinel-1.
# Those two disagree on how several quantities are obtained — NISAR looks left and derives the pulse
# repetition frequency from the zero-Doppler time spacing, Sentinel-1 looks right and derives it from
# the azimuth time interval — which is why `look_side` and `prf` are fields here rather than
# constants.

One burst of a TOPS acquisition, however it was delivered.

A Sentinel-1 product is distributed both as a whole `.SAFE`, whose bursts are stacked in one raster per
subswath, and as one file per burst. Both describe the same thing, so a backend of either kind answers
the same five questions — [`burst_index`](@ref), [`burst_swath`](@ref), [`burst_polarization`](@ref),
[`burst_source`](@ref) and [`orbit_path`](@ref) — and merging asks those rather than naming the formats

    is_tops(s::SLC) -> Bool
    is_tops(b::AbstractSLCBackend) -> Bool

Whether the acquisition was collected in TOPS mode.

TOPS — Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans, which is how Sentinel-1 IW and EW are acquired — steers
the antenna in azimuth across each burst. That puts a steep, burst-varying ramp on the azimuth phase, so
the samples are not directly interpolable: a consumer resampling them onto another grid has to remove the
ramp first and reapply it on the output, and one that interpolates without doing so aliases it. Amplitudes
are unaffected, since taking the magnitude discards the phase.

So this is the question a consumer of the *samples* has to ask, and the reason it lives here rather than
with the consumer: whether an acquisition is TOPS is a property of how the product was collected, which
this package reads and a geometry or correlation package cannot infer.

Every [`AbstractBurstBackend`](@ref) is TOPS by construction — the type means "one burst of a TOPS
acquisition" — and so is a merge of them. A NISAR RSLC is stripmap and is not.

What this does *not* say is whether the ramp has already been removed. A product is delivered ramped; a
processor that deramps writes its own product. Were a deramped Sentinel-1 product to arrive here it would
still report `true`, so a consumer holding one has to override rather than ask.
[`deramp_parameters`](@ref) returns what removing the ramp needs.

entry nearest the burst it is working on — see [`nearest_polynomial`](@ref) — and evaluates it at a slant
range in meters.

`r0` is the reference range, not an offset into the image: the argument is `range - r0`, so the constant

    DerampParameters

What removing one burst's TOPS azimuth ramp needs, from the annotation alone.

The ramp is quadratic in azimuth about the burst's own center, with a coefficient that varies across the
swath. Reconstructing it needs the azimuth FM rate and the Doppler centroid as functions of slant range —
both `RangePolynomial`s, already selected for this burst — the antenna steering rate, and the scales that
turn a pixel index into a range and an azimuth time.

# Fields
- `azimuth_fm_rate`, `doppler_centroid`: the polynomials for this burst, in slant range (meters).
- `azimuth_steering_rate`: how fast the antenna sweeps in azimuth, in radians per second.
- `wavelength`: meters.
- `azimuth_time_interval`: seconds per line.
- `starting_range`, `range_pixel_spacing`: meters, for `range = starting_range + sample * spacing`.
- `lines_per_burst`: the burst's azimuth extent, whose half is the center the ramp is referenced to.
- `burst_mid`: the burst's mid instant, which is where an orbit is interpolated for the along-track speed.

What is *not* here is the orbit. The steering rate enters as `2 * |v| * rate / wavelength`, and `|v|` is
the platform speed at `burst_mid` — which needs an interpolator this package does not have, since it holds
tabulated state vectors rather than a trajectory. So the consumer computes that term from `burst_mid` and
its own orbit; see [`orbit`](@ref) for the vectors to build one from.

What removing `burst`'s TOPS azimuth ramp needs.

The polynomials are selected by time: the annotation estimates the azimuth FM rate and the Doppler
centroid on its own schedule rather than once per burst, and the entry nearest this burst's mid-time
applies to it, as `s1reader`'s `get_nearest_polynomial` does.
